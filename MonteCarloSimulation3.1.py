Question 3.1.
Script a Monte Carlo Simulation that allows the user to estimate the area under any given
function between any two points over a positive area. Compare your simulation results with the
actual area under the standard normal density, as a test function. Show the development of the
error rate over the number of simulations (n = 100, 200, â€¦, 10.000). Solve this task by using
object orientated programming (OOP). Therefore, define a class object MonteCarloSim() which
suffices the following UML diagram.
