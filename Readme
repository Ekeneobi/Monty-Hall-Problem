# 1.1 
Write a one-round simulation of the Monty Hall Problem (“Let’s make a deal”) according to the following rules:
(6 points)
a) Write a function that randomly defines where the first price (a car), the second price (a money envelope) and the third price (a Zonk) is hidden.
b) Let the player choose one of the doors (e.g. 1,2.3).
c) The moderator will never open the door with the first prize behind it. But once the player has chosen the door with the first price, the moderator will randomly reveal a door with either the second or the third price behind it.
d) After revealing a door, the moderator asks the player whether to change the door or not.
e) Tell the player what price he won.
# 1.2 
Write a program for an arbitrary (e.g. n = 1.000) number of simulations for the above problem and count the results of winning the first price.
(5 points)
a) Does it pay off for the participant of the game show to switch doors after the moderator has opened one door.
b) Explain the results.
c) What is the expected probability to win if you randomly choose to change doors or not? Backup your expectation by another simulation.
Hint: Compare the relative frequency to win after changing doors with the relative frequency to win without changing doors. Write a function that determines the wins for a given strategy (“change”, “noChange” or “random”).
